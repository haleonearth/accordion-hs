          <h3>Models</h3>
          <p style="max-width: 950px; margin-bottom: 55px;">The Binder Lift is available in two models â€“
            <strong>Nylon</strong> and <strong>Vinyl</strong>. Both models are proudly made in the USA and are covered
            by a 5-year warranty. The <strong>Vinyl</strong> model is made completely from medical-grade impervious
            materials, so decontamination and cleaning is quick and easy. Decontaminating and cleaning the
            <strong>Nylon</strong> model requires a machine wash and low-temperature drying.
